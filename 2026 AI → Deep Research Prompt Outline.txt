## REQUIRED SECTIONS (DO NOT SKIP)

---

### 1. 🧭 Provider Overview & Positioning

**1.1 One-Sentence Definition (Descriptive Only)**
- What the provider does, stated factually
- No superlatives, no evaluation, no future claims
- 25 words max; if unknown, say "Unknown"

**1.2 Problem Scope**
- Problems the provider is designed to solve
- Problems it is explicitly not designed to solve
- Be concrete; avoid generic categories

**1.3 Target User & Buyer**
- Primary user persona(s)
- Primary buyer (if different)
- Who this is not built for
- Use role/industry titles; avoid "everyone"

**1.4 Ecosystem Placement**
- Where the provider sits relative to adjacent tool categories
- Upstream/downstream dependencies
- No competitive judgment here
- Name explicit inputs and outputs (data, formats, integrations)

**1.5 Positioning Snapshot**
- Core focus
- Defining constraint
- Implied tradeoff
- 3-6 words each; no full sentences

### 2. 🧾 Model Catalog (Complete Inventory) **(REQUIRED)**

**2.1 Inventory Table — Atomic Models Only**
Each row represents a single, distinct model or deployable variant.
Do not merge variants; list separate rows for size, precision, or context-window differences.

Required columns:
- Model Name (exact)
- Family / Tier (only if explicitly named)
- Primary Modality
- Intended Use (provider-stated; label and cite)
- Key Strengths (provider-stated or evidenced)
- Key Constraints / Known Weaknesses
- Availability (API / app / enterprise; public vs gated)
- Status (GA / Beta / Preview / Deprecated)
- Release / Last Update (YYYY-MM if known; else Unknown)
- Sources (one+ per row)

**2.2 Intent & Evidence Labeling**
- Clearly distinguish provider-stated intent vs analyst inference
- Explicitly label inferred intent
- Use labels: [Stated] / [Inference]

**2.3 Legacy / Deprecated Models**
- Separate table
- Same columns
- Include replacement or deprecation signals if stated
- Include deprecation date if provided

**2.4 Coverage, Gaps, and Uncertainty**
- Likely missing models
- Reason for omissions (enterprise-only, undocumented, ambiguous branding)
- Evidence required to confirm completeness
- State confidence: High / Medium / Low

**2.5 Catalog-Level Takeaway**
- Maturity implications
- Specialization vs generality
- Maintenance velocity
- One sentence max

---

### 3. 🧩 Core Capabilities & Modalities
- Supported modalities
- Key technical capabilities
- Mapping of capabilities to models listed in Section 2
- Known strengths and known gaps relevant to building and experimentation

---

### 4. 🏗️ Technical Architecture (High-Level)
- Publicly known or reasonably inferred architecture details
- Training approach (if disclosed)
- Inference characteristics (latency, throughput, scaling assumptions)
- Deployment model (API, hosted app, local, hybrid)

Explicitly label what is **known**, **inferred**, or **unknown**.

---

### 5. 📏 Performance, Quality, and Benchmarks

**5.1 Benchmark Availability & Scope**
- Available benchmarks by name
- Models each benchmark applies to
- What each benchmark measures
- Use a table if more than 3 benchmarks (Benchmark | Models | Metric | Source)

**5.2 Benchmark Relevance Assessment**
- Real-world behaviors correlated
- What is not measured
- Known biases or limitations
- One bullet per benchmark; no blended claims

**5.3 Real-World Performance Signals**
- Credible user or deployment evidence
- Distinguish isolated anecdotes from repeated patterns
- Label source type: provider / third-party / user reports

**5.4 Consistency & Failure Modes**
- Common failure patterns
- Stability across workloads
- Edge cases where quality degrades
- Tie failure modes to model and workload

**5.5 Practical Performance Summary**
- ✅ Reliable scenarios
- ⚠️ Inconsistent scenarios
- ❌ Inadequate scenarios  
(tied to specific models where possible)
- 2-4 bullets each; include model names and evidence tags

---

### 6. 💳 Pricing, Limits, and Economic Model
- Pricing structure and tiers
- Rate limits, quotas, and usage constraints
- Cost predictability for experimentation and small-scale production
- Cost-efficiency relative to comparable alternatives

---

### 7. 🛡️ Safety, Policy, and Governance
- Content policies and enforcement mechanisms
- Safety systems (if disclosed)
- Constraints affecting experimentation or product building
- Known incidents, controversies, or regulatory exposure

---

### 8. 🌍 Adoption, Ecosystem, and Real-World Usage
- Evidence of real-world adoption
- Production vs experimental usage signals
- Notable case studies or public deployments
- Gaps between claimed and observed adoption

---

### 9. 🥊 Competitive Landscape

**9.1 Direct Competitors**
