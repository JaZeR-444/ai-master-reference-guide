# 00_Inbox - Unsorted Materials

## Purpose
This is a temporary holding area for new materials before they are triaged and moved to appropriate artifact folders.

## Workflow
1. Drop links, PDFs, screenshots, or notes here immediately when discovered
2. Review weekly and sort into appropriate folders (01-08)
3. Keep this folder as empty as possible

## Types of Content
- [ ] Unsorted URLs and bookmarks
- [ ] Downloaded PDFs or documents
- [ ] Screenshot captures
- [ ] Quick notes and observations
- [ ] Email forwards or shared content

## Sorting Guidelines
- **Official documentation** → `01_Official_Docs`
- **Blog posts/articles** → `02_Reference_and_Writeups`
- **Research papers** → `03_Papers_and_Benchmarks`
- **Pricing info** → `04_Pricing_and_Policies`
- **Code samples** → `05_Code_and_Examples`
- **Test results** → `06_Evals_and_Testing`
- **Images/videos** → `07_Assets_and_Media`
- **Personal thoughts** → `08_Notes`

## Best Practices
- Date-stamp files: `YYYY-MM-DD_description.ext`
- Use descriptive filenames
- Don't let items sit longer than 2 weeks
- Delete duplicates immediately
