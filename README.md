# AI Research Library

This repository is a structured, long-term research archive covering AI models, platforms, and creative tools.

## Structure
- Top-level folders represent AI capability categories.
- Each provider appears exactly once under its primary category.
- Each provider folder follows a standardized artifact-based subfolder schema.

## Rules
- Do not duplicate providers across categories.
- Drop new materials into `00_Inbox` first, then sort.
- Keep artifacts atomic (one idea per note where possible).

## Status
This library is actively evolving.
