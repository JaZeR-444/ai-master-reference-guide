# AIVA Research Summary (Dec 2025)

- **Best for:** Composers, Game Devs, MIDI users.
- **Key Edge:** Symbolic editing (Piano Roll) and MIDI export.
- **Verdict:** Still the best for "working" musicians who need an AI assistant, not an AI replacement.
- **Watch Area:** Vocal synthesis improvements (currently a weakness).
