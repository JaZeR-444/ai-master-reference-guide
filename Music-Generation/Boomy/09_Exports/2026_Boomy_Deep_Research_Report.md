## 3. Core Capabilities
- **Instant Generation:** Pick a style (Lo-Fi, Hip-Hop, EDM) and get a track in 30 seconds.
- **Vocal Integration:** Upload or record vocals directly into the track.
- **Automated Distribution:** Integrated workflow to send music to DSPs (Spotify, TikTok, etc.).
- **Royalty Tracking:** Dashboard for monitoring earnings from streams.

---

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Inferred:** Likely uses a modular generative system that assembles high-quality loops and patterns based on AI-determined rules. It feels more "algorithmic" than "neural" in its core sequencing, but audio quality suggests neural post-processing.
- **Deployment:** Web-based and Mobile (iOS/macOS).

## 6. Pricing & Economics (2026)
- **Free:** 25 saves, 1 release.
- **Creator ($10-15/mo):** 500 saves, 10-25 downloads, limited releases.
- **Pro ($30-40/mo):** Unlimited saves, 250 WAV downloads, full commercial rights, expedited reviews.
- **Economic Model:** Heavily focused on the potential ROI from streaming royalties.

---

## 7. Safety & Policy
- **Content:** Strict reviews for AI-generated spam on streaming services (especially after Spotify's 2023 purge of AI tracks). Boomy has worked to improve "quality signals" to prevent future bans.

---

## 9. Competitive Landscape
- **Vs. Suno/Udio:** Suno/Udio make "better" sounding songs with vocals; Boomy is better for those who want to *publish* and *own* a catalog of music.
- **Vs. Soundraw:** Soundraw is for *using* music in videos; Boomy is for *being* the artist.

---

## 11. Strategic Assessment
- **When to invest:** If you want to experiment with the "AI Music Artist" business model or need a massive amount of generic background tracks for a personal library.
- **When to skip:** If you need high-fidelity, emotionally resonant music for a professional brand.
- **Confidence Level:** Medium-High (Boomy's relationship with streaming platforms is its biggest risk/reward factor).
